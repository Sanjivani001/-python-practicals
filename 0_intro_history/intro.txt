Python: A Brief History
🔹 Who created Python?
Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer.

He started working on Python in late 1980s and officially released Python 0.9.0 in 1991.

🔹 Why was Python created?
Guido wanted a language that was:

Easy to read and write

Had clear syntax

Was suitable for both beginners and advanced users

He was inspired by the ABC language (also developed at CWI, Netherlands).

🔹 Why the name "Python"?
Not after the snake 🐍!

Guido was a fan of the British comedy group Monty Python’s Flying Circus — so the name is a tribute to them.
